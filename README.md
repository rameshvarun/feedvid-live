This is the source release of FeedVid Live, a puzzle game that I released on Itch.io in 2022. It's a re-imagining of the text adventure genre, presenting players with a fictional livestream where they must type commands to control the actions of a livestreamer. The game mixes parser-based puzzle solving with real-time 3D graphics.
